# Team 05 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

Simply based on people's preferences.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Through Discord. We will notify the team when we have pushed something.

## How will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Through Discord.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

If we are having difficulties, we will notify the team.
